{- We can define a inductive data type with the keyword "data
   after that we write the name (here "Bool") and than the kind
   after the colon.  Which is Set here (a kind wihout a context)
   The constructor defnintions need to be indentet on the same
   level.  We define two ("True" and "False") Constructors.  After
   a colon we write the type.  We always need one type which can
   contain a recursive occurence (which is not the case for bool).
   For "data" the result type needs to be the defined type.  We
   have to write it behind an arrow "->" at the end of the line
   "Unit" is a primitve type with one inhabitant "()"-}
